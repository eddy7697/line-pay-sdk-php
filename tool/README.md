```php
<?php

return [
    [
        "title" => "First Merchant",

        "channelId" => "{your channelId}",
        "channelSecret" => "{your channelSecret}",
    ],
];
```

> Warning: Saved merchants will be operated by the tool through the API with the merchant credentials, please add the sandbox merchant account only.
